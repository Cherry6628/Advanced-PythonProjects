Project INIFISIA:

    Project INIFISIA is my many months work and 
    not yet completed.

    This Project took me a lot of time and will
    consume some efforts to make  this a Worthy 
    One.

    My Project allows user to interact with th-
    -eir Device (PC) only with Gestures.
    
    Currently Implemented only for Hand Detect-
    -ion and Cursor Movement.

    Soon, Many Features will be added and I am 
    Constantly under work to finish this.  Not
    for someone, but for my curiousity and for
    my own wish.

    Might take some long time, Since I have my
    personal works to do and only Developer in
    this project is me.

    I Hope that this would be completed perfe-
    -ctly soon.
    
    Probably, No one visits my Github Profile.
    But, I am doing this only for my own happ-
    -iness and dedication.  But,  Anyway Thank
    You for visiting my project page.

    If you love my projects, Please Support me
    (Not Financially,  But Simply  by your act
    of following me and by providing Stars for
    my projects.)
